```proto
    Protocol Buffers are language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanisms for serializing structured data.

    Protocol buffers are ideal for any situation in which you need to serialize structured, record-like, typed data in a 
    language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible manner. 
    They are most often used for defining communications protocols (together with gRPC) and for data storage.

    Some of the advantages of using protocol buffers include:

    Compact data storage
    Fast parsing
    Availability in many programming languages
    Optimized functionality through automatically-generated classes
```

```grpc
    We wanted the communication between the client and the server to be as small as possible,
    as secure as possible and fully compliant with both ends (thus we chose Protobuf).
```
