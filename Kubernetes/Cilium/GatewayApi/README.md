# [Cilium Gateway API](https://isovalent.com/labs/cilium-gateway-api/)

## üåü Welcome to the Gateway API Lab

Before we can install Cilium with the Gateway API feature, there are a couple of important prerequisites to know:

Cilium must be configured with kubeProxyReplacement set to true.

CRD (Custom Resource Definition) from Gateway API must be installed beforehand.

As part of the lab deployment script, several CRDs were installed. Verify that they are available.

```sh
kubectl api-resources | grep gateway

kubectl get crd \
  gatewayclasses.gateway.networking.k8s.io \
  gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io \
  httproutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io \
  referencegrants.gateway.networking.k8s.io \
  tlsroutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io
```

During the lab deployment, Cilium was installed using the following command:

```sh
cilium install --version 1.14.3 \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set kubeProxyReplacement=true \
  --set gatewayAPI.enabled=true \
```

Let's have a look at our lab environment and see if Cilium has been installed correctly. The following command will wait for Cilium to be up and running and report its status:

```sh
cilium status --wait
```

Verify that Cilium was enabled and deployed with the Gateway API feature:

```sh
cilium config view | grep -w "enable-gateway-api"
```

## üõ£Ô∏è What are a GatewayClass and a Gateway?
If the CRDs have been deployed beforehand, a GatewayClass will be deployed by Cilium during its installation (assuming the Gateway API option has been selected).

Let's verify that a GatewayClass has been deployed and accepted:

```sh
kubectl get GatewayClass
```

The GatewayClass is a type of Gateway that can be deployed: in other words, it is a template. This is done in a way to let infrastructure providers offer different types of Gateways. Users can then choose the Gateway they like.

For instance, an infrastructure provider may create two GatewayClasses named internet and private to reflect Gateways that define Internet-facing vs private, internal applications.

In our case, the Cilium Gateway API (io.cilium/gateway-controller) will be instantiated.

This schema below represents the various components used by Gateway APIs. When using Ingress, all the functionalities were defined in one API. By deconstructing the ingress routing requirements into multiple APIs, users benefit from a more generic, flexible and role-oriented model.

![Topology](https://play.instruqt.com/assets/tracks/ndhj358im0mf/6475cefe7240dd9335c2aed1dc6b8f10/assets/api-model.png)

The actual L7 traffic rules are defined in the HTTPRoute API.

In the next challenge, you will deploy an application and set up GatewayAPI HTTPRoutes to route HTTP traffic into the cluster.

## üöÄ Deploy an application

Let's deploy the sample application in the cluster.

```sh
kubectl apply -f /opt/bookinfo.yml
```

You can find more details about the Bookinfo application on the Istio website.

Check that the application is properly deployed:

```sh
root@server:~# kubectl get pods
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
details-v1-6448f9bdc8-rzhmc       1/1     Running   0          2m44s
productpage-v1-65b8499c86-4nsl7   1/1     Running   0          2m44s
ratings-v1-56687d6766-kcbjc       1/1     Running   0          2m44s
reviews-v1-5c785db578-kgnwj       1/1     Running   0          2m44s
reviews-v2-6d8c88978b-rpmj6       1/1     Running   0          2m44s
reviews-v3-678b968858-scf8v       1/1     Running   0          2m44s
```

You should see multiple pods being deployed in the default namespace. Wait until they are Running (should take 30 to 45 seconds).

Notice that with Cilium Service Mesh there is no Envoy sidecar created alongside each of the demo app microservices. With a sidecar implementation the output would show 2/2 READY: one for the microservice and one for the Envoy sidecar.

Have a quick look at the Services deployed:

```sh
root@server:~# kubectl get svc
NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
details       ClusterIP   10.96.177.132   <none>        9080/TCP   83s
kubernetes    ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP    38m
productpage   ClusterIP   10.96.22.42     <none>        9080/TCP   83s
ratings       ClusterIP   10.96.114.195   <none>        9080/TCP   83s
reviews       ClusterIP   10.96.13.163    <none>        9080/TCP   83s
```

Note these Services are only internal-facing (ClusterIP) and therefore there is no access from outside the cluster to these Services.

```sh
kubectl apply -f basic-http.yaml
```
```yaml

    namespace: default
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /details
    backendRefs:
    - name: details
      port: 9080
  - matches:
    - headers:
      - type: Exact
        name: magic
        value: foo
      queryParams:
      - type: Exact
        name: great
        value: example
      path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
      method: GET
    backendRefs:
    - name: productpage
      port: 9080
```

First, note in the Gateway section that the gatewayClassName field uses the value cilium. This refers to the Cilium GatewayClass previously configured.

The Gateway will listen on port 80 for HTTP traffic coming southbound into the cluster. The allowedRoutes is here to specify the namespaces from which Routes may be attached to this Gateway. Same means only Routes in the same namespace may be used by this Gateway.

Note that, if we were to use All instead of Same, we would enable this gateway to be associated with routes in any namespace and it would enable us to use a single gateway across multiple namespaces that may be managed by different teams.

We could specify different namespaces in the HTTPRoutes ‚Äì therefore, for example, you could send the traffic to https://acme.com/payments in a namespace where a payment app is deployed and https://acme.com/ads in a namespace used by the ads team for their application.

Let's now review the HTTPRoute manifest. HTTPRoute is a GatewayAPI type for specifiying routing behaviour of HTTP requests from a Gateway listener to a Kubernetes Service.

It is made of Rules to direct the traffic based on your requirements.

This first Rule is essentially a simple L7 proxy route: for HTTP traffic with a path starting with /details, forward the traffic over to the details Service over port 9080.

```yaml
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /details
    backendRefs:
    - name: details
      port: 9080
```

The second rule is similar but it's leveraging different matching criteria. If the HTTP request has:

a HTTP header with a name set to magic with a value of foo, AND the HTTP method is "GET", AND the HTTP query param is named great with a value of example, Then the traffic will be sent to the productpage service over port 9080.

```yaml
 rules:
  - matches:
   - headers:
      - type: Exact
        name: magic
        value: foo
      queryParams:
      - type: Exact
        name: great
        value: example
      path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
      method: GET
    backendRefs:
    - name: productpage
      port: 9080
```

As you can see, you can deploy sophisticated L7 traffic rules that are consistent (with Ingress API, annotations were often required to achieve such routing goals and that created inconsistencies from one Ingress controller to another).

One of the benefits of these new APIs is that the Gateway API is essentially split into separate functions ‚Äì one to describe the Gateway and one for the Routes to the back-end services. By splitting these two functions, it gives operators the ability to change and swap gateways but keep the same routing configuration.

In other words: if you decide you want to use a different Gateway API controller instead, you will be able to re-use the same manifest.

Let's have another look at the Services now that the Gateway has been deployed:

```sh
kubectl get svc
```

You will see a LoadBalancer service named cilium-gateway-my-gateway which was created for the Gateway API.

```txt
Note
When Cilium was installed during the boot-up of the lab, it was enabled with LoadBalancer capabilities. Cilium will therefore automatically provision an IP address for it and announce this IP address over Layer 2 locally (which is how connectivity from your terminal to the Gateway IP address will be achieved).
```

If you would like to explore this functionality, try out the L2 Announcement lab.

The same external IP address is also associated to the Gateway:

```sh
kubectl get gateway
```

Let's retrieve this IP address:

```sh
GATEWAY=$(kubectl get gateway my-gateway -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
echo $GATEWAY
```

Let's now check that traffic based on the URL path is proxied by the Gateway API.

Check that you can make HTTP requests to that external address:

```sh
curl --fail -s http://$GATEWAY/details/1 | jq
curl -v -H 'magic: foo' "http://$GATEWAY?great=example"
```

Because the path starts with /details, this traffic will match the first rule and will be proxied to the details Service over port 9080.

## üåê Deploying a HTTPS Gateway

While these examples with HTTP help us understanding Gateway API specifications, HTTPS is obviously the more secure and preferred option.

Let's see how we can use Gateway API for a HTTPS application using Cilium!

## üîë Create TLS certificate and private key
In this task, we will be using Gateway API for HTTPS traffic routing; therefore we will need a TLS certificate for data encryption.

For demonstration purposes we will use a TLS certificate signed by a made-up, self-signed certificate authority (CA). One easy way to do this is with mkcert.

Create a certificate that will validate bookinfo.cilium.rocks and hipstershop.cilium.rocks, as these are the host names used in this Gateway example:

mkcert '*.cilium.rocks'
Mkcert created a key (_wildcard.cilium.rocks-key.pem) and a certificate (_wildcard.cilium.rocks.pem) that we will use for the Gateway service.

Create a Kubernetes TLS secret with this key and certificate:

kubectl create secret tls demo-cert \
  --key=_wildcard.cilium.rocks-key.pem \
  --cert=_wildcard.cilium.rocks.pem

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: tls-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: cilium
  listeners:
    - name: https-1
      protocol: HTTPS
      port: 443
      hostname: "bookinfo.cilium.rocks"
      tls:
        certificateRefs:
          - kind: Secret
            name: demo-cert
    - name: https-2
      protocol: HTTPS
      port: 443
      hostname: "hipstershop.cilium.rocks"
      tls:
        certificateRefs:
          - kind: Secret
            name: demo-cert
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: https-app-route-1
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: tls-gateway
  hostnames:
    - "bookinfo.cilium.rocks"
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /details
      backendRefs:
        - name: details
          port: 9080
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: https-app-route-2
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: tls-gateway
  hostnames:
    - "hipstershop.cilium.rocks"
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
      backendRefs:
        - name: productpage
          port: 9080
```

The HTTPS Gateway API examples build up on what was done in the HTTP example and adds TLS termination for two HTTP routes:

the /details prefix will be routed to the details HTTP service deployed in the HTTP challenge
the / prefix will be routed to the productpage HTTP service deployed in the HTTP challenge
These services will be secured via TLS and accessible on two domain names:

bookinfo.cilium.rocks
hipstershop.cilium.rocks

In our example, the Gateway serves the TLS certificate defined in the demo-cert Secret resource for all requests to bookinfo.cilium.rocks and to hipstershop.cilium.rocks.

Let's now deploy the Gateway to the cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f basic-https.yaml
```

This creates a LoadBalancer service, which after around 30 seconds or so should be populated with an external IP address.

Verify that the Gateway has an load balancer IP address assigned:

```sh
kubectl get gateway tls-gateway

GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl get gateway tls-gateway -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
echo $GATEWAY_IP
```

Then assign this IP to the GATEWAY_IP variable so we can make use of it:

Install the Mkcert CA into your system so cURL can trust it:

```sh
mkcert -install
```

Now let's make a request to the Gateway:

```sh
curl -s \
  --resolve bookinfo.cilium.rocks:443:${GATEWAY_IP} \
  https://bookinfo.cilium.rocks/details/1 | jq
```

The data should be properly retrieved, using HTTPS (and thus, the TLS handshake was properly achieved).

In the next challenge, we will see how to use Gateway API for general TLS traffic.

## üõ£Ô∏è TLSRoute

In the previous task, we looked at the TLS Termination and how the Gateway can terminate HTTPS traffic from a client and route the unencrypted HTTP traffic based on HTTP properties, like path, method or headers.

In this task, we will look at a feature that was introduced in Cilium 1.14: TLSRoute. This resource lets you passthrough TLS traffic from the client all the way to the Pods - meaning the traffic is encrypted end-to-end.

üöÄ Deploy the Demo App
We will be using a NGINX web server. Review the NGINX configuration.

```sh
cat nginx.conf
```

As you can see, it listens on port 443 for SSL traffic. Notice it specifies the certificate and key previously created.

We will need to mount the files to the right path (/etc/nginx-server-certs) when we deploy the server.

The NGINX server configuration is held in a Kubernetes ConfigMap. Let's create it.

```sh
kubectl create configmap nginx-configmap --from-file=nginx.conf=./nginx.conf
```

Review the NGINX server Deployment and the Service fronting it:

```sh
yq tls-service.yaml

As you can see, we are deploying a container with the nginx image, mounting several files such as the HTML index, the NGINX configuration and the certs. Note that we are reusing the demo-cert TLS secret we created earlier.

kubectl apply -f tls-service.yaml
Verify the Service and Deployment have been deployed successfully:

kubectl get svc,deployment my-nginx

## üö™ Deploy the Gateway
Review the Gateway API configuration files provided in the current directory:

yq tls-gateway.yaml \
   tls-route.yaml
```

They are almost identical to the one we reviewed in the previous tasks. Just notice the Passthrough mode set in the Gateway manifest:

```yaml
root@server:~# cat nginx.conf
events {
}

http {
  log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local]  $status '
  '"$request" $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
  '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
  access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;
  error_log  /var/log/nginx/error.log;

  server {
    listen 443 ssl;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;

    server_name nginx.cilium.rocks;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx-server-certs/tls.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx-server-certs/tls.key;
  }
}

        - name: my-nginx
          port: 443
```

Previously, we used the HTTPRoute resource. This time, we are using TLSRoute:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: TLSRoute
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: cilium-tls-gateway
  hostnames:
  - "nginx.cilium.rocks"
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: my-nginx
      port: 443
```

Earlier you saw how you can terminate the TLS connection at the Gateway. That was using the Gateway API in Terminate mode. In this instance, the Gateway is in Passthrough mode: the difference is that the traffic remains encrypted all the way through between the client and the pod.

In other words:

In Terminate:

Client -> Gateway: HTTPS
Gateway -> Pod: HTTP
In Passthrough:

Client -> Gateway: HTTPS
Gateway -> Pod: HTTPS

The Gateway does not actually inspect the traffic aside from using the SNI header for routing. Indeed the hostnames field defines a set of SNI names that should match against the SNI attribute of TLS ClientHello message in TLS handshake.

Let's now deploy the Gateway and the TLSRoute to the cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f tls-gateway.yaml -f tls-route.yaml
```

This creates a LoadBalancer service, which after around 30 seconds or so should be populated with an external IP address.

Verify that the Gateway has a LoadBalancer IP address assigned:

```sh
kubectl get gateway cilium-tls-gateway
```

Then assign this IP to the GATEWAY_IP variable so we can make use of it:

```sh
GATEWAY_IP=$(kubectl get gateway cilium-tls-gateway -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
echo $GATEWAY_IP
```

Let's also double check the TLSRoute has been provisioned successfully and has been attached to the Gateway.

```sh
kubectl get tlsroutes.gateway.networking.k8s.io -o json | jq '.items[0].status.parents[0]'

Expect an outcome such as:

{
  "conditions": [
    {
      "lastTransitionTime": "2023-06-08T10:23:45Z",
      "message": "Accepted TLSRoute",
      "observedGeneration": 1,
      "reason": "Accepted",
      "status": "True",
      "type": "Accepted"
    }
  ],
  "controllerName": "io.cilium/gateway-controller",
  "parentRef": {
    "group": "gateway.networking.k8s.io",
    "kind": "Gateway",
    "name": "cilium-tls-gateway"
  }
}
```

## üåê Make TLS requests
Now let's make a request over HTTPS to the Gateway:

```sh
curl -v \
  --resolve "nginx.cilium.rocks:443:$GATEWAY_IP" \
  "https://nginx.cilium.rocks:443"
```

The data should be properly retrieved, using HTTPS (and thus, the TLS handshake was properly achieved).

There are several things to note in the output.

It should be successful (you should see at the end, a HTML output with Cilium rocks.).
The connection was established over port 443 - you should see Connected to nginx.cilium.rocks (172.18.255.200) port 443 .
You should see TLS handshake and TLS version negotiation. Expect the negotiations to have resulted in TLSv1.3 being used.
Expect to see a successful certificate verification (look out for SSL certificate verify ok).
Press Check to move to the next task.

## ü™ì Traffic splitting

Cilium Gateway API comes fully integrated with a HTTP traffic splitting engine.

In order to introduce a new version of an app, operators would often start pushing some traffic to a new backend and see how users react and how the app fares under load. It‚Äôs also known as A/B testing, blue-green deployments or canary releases.

You can now do it natively, with Cilium Gateway API weights. No need to install another tool or Service Mesh.

## üöÄ Deploy an application

First, let's deploy a sample echo application in the cluster. The application will reply to the client and, in the body of the reply, will include information about the pod and node receiving the original request. We will use this information to illustrate that the traffic is split between multiple Kubernetes Services.

```sh
kubectl apply -f echo-servers.yaml
```

Look at the YAML file with the command below. You'll see we are deploying multiple pods and services. The services are called echo-1 and echo-2 and traffic will be split between these services.

```sh
yq echo-servers.yaml
```

Check that the application is properly deployed:

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

You should see multiple pods being deployed in the default namespace. Wait until they are Running (should take 10 to 15 seconds).

Have a quick look at the Services deployed:

```sh
kubectl get svc
```

Note these Services are only internal-facing (ClusterIP) and therefore there is no access from outside the cluster to these Services.

## üö™Load-Balance Traffic
Let's deploy the HTTPRoute with the following manifest:

```sh
kubectl apply -f load-balancing-http-route.yaml
```

Let's review the HTTPRoute manifest.

yq load-balancing-http-route.yaml
This Rule is essentially a simple L7 proxy route: for HTTP traffic with a path starting with /echo, forward the traffic over to the echo-1 and echo-2 Services over port 8080 and 8090 respectively.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: load-balancing-route
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: my-gateway
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /echo
      backendRefs:
        - kind: Service
          name: echo-1
          port: 8080
          weight: 50
        - kind: Service
          name: echo-2
          port: 8090
          weight: 50
```

Notice the even 50/50 weighing.

## ‚úÇÔ∏è Even Traffic Splitting

Let's retrieve the IP address associated with the Gateway again:

```sh
GATEWAY=$(kubectl get gateway my-gateway -o jsonpath='{.status.addresses[0].value}')
echo $GATEWAY
```

Let's now check that traffic based on the URL path is proxied by the Gateway API.

Check that you can make HTTP requests to that external address:

```sh
curl --fail -s http://$GATEWAY/echo
```

Notice that, in the reply, you get the name of the pod that received the query. For example:

Hostname: echo-2-5bfb6668b4-2rl4t
Note that you can also see the headers in the original request. This will be useful in an upcoming task.

Repeat the command several times.

You should see the reply being balanced evenly across both pods/nodes.

Let's double check that traffic is evenly split across multiple Pods by running a loop and counting the requests:

```sh
for _ in {1..500}; do
  curl -s -k "http://$GATEWAY/echo" >> curlresponses.txt;
done
Verify that the responses have been (more or less) evenly spread.

grep -o "Hostname: echo-." curlresponses.txt | sort | uniq -c
```

## üî¢ 99/1 Traffic Split

This time, we will be applying a different weight.

We could change the previous manifest and re-apply it or, if you don't mind using vi, we can edit the HTTPRoute specification directly on the API Server. Let's use this second option. Run:

```sh
kubectl edit httproute load-balancing-route
The vi editor will be automatically launch.

Replace the weights from 50 for both echo-1 and echo-2 to 99 for echo-1 and 1 for echo-2.

Exit the editor using ESC followed by :wq (to save the file as you exit).

Let's run another loop and count the replies again, with the following command:

for _ in {1..500}; do
  curl -s -k "http://$GATEWAY/echo" >> curlresponses991.txt;
done
Verify that the responses are spread with about 99% of them to echo-1 and about 1% of them to echo-2.

grep -o "Hostname: echo-." curlresponses991.txt | sort | uniq -c
```
